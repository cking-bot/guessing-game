# guessing-game
### A random number guessing game written in python. It is connected to a postgres database and does require your own database to run. I used a secrets file to store the database connection variables. In this case it was a secrets.env file. Please do the same and add your own connection variables. 

## Requirements:
### Please run pip install -r requirements.txt to get all of the required modules. I would also recommend setting up a virtual environments before doing so.

## Features:
### The main features are:
- 1. The game has register and login functions so that it can track individual instances of the game. 
- 2. The game tracks total wins and losses! After an individual logsin, the game will print their total wins and losses once the game is complete.
- 3. You are able to start the game with a range of 1 - 10, or you can set the range yourself.

## Starting the game:
### To start the game make sure you are in the games directory. Then run python3 game.py and you are good to go!
