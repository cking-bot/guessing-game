# guessing-game
### A random number guessing game written in python. It is connected to a postgres database and does require your own database to run. I used a secrets file to store the database connection variables. In this case it was a secrets.env file. Please do the same and add your own connection variables. 

## Requirements:
### Please run pip install -r requirements.txt to get all of the required modules. I would also recommend setting up a virtual environments before doing so.

## Features:
### The main features are:
- 1. The game has register and login functions so that it can track individual instances of the game. It also tracks total wins and losses so individuals can login and it will keep track of those wins and losses.

## Starting the game:
### to start the game make sure you are in the games directory. Then run python3 game.py and you are good to go!
